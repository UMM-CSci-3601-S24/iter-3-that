## What is Scav-a-Snap
Scav-a-Snap is a photo scavenger hunt app for anyone looking for an exciting team-building experience. It provides all ages with enjoyable lasting memories. 

Scav-a-Snap gives users the opportunity to create and host personalized hunts for a group of hunters. A hunt consists of a title, description, estimated time, and tasks. Once a hunt is created, the host can edit the title, description, and estimated time. There is also the functionality of adding and removing tasks. When a host creates a hunt, that hunt is a part of their profile and will be available for them to use as many times as they want and can also be deleted if desired.

Once a host choses the number of teams they would like to participate, they may begin a hunt. A started hunt will have a unique access code that hunters may use to join the hunt. By entering the access code, a hunter will be able to create a team and add all members to the team. Only one device can be used for each team of hunters.

After joining the hunt, each team can complete tasks by capturing pictures of specific items or locations. The host can track the progress the teams are making and have the option to end the hunt whenever they would like. When the hunt ends, the host can view the hunt at any time by selecting it on their profile page. They can view all the photos submitted for each task with captions labeling what team took what photo.
